# `changelog.d/` — towncrier news fragments

Per-change fragments for `sheng`. They fold into
[`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) on release build — not something you
hand-edit into the changelog mid-PR.

```bash
towncrier create +<slug>.<type>.md
# write the fragment body, then on release:
towncrier build --version x.y.z
```

Fragment shape: `+<slug>.<type>.md`. Write one in the *same PR* as any
user-visible / API / behavior / perf / security change. Skip only for
comment-only, format-only, or pure-internal refactors with zero observable
delta — when unsure, write the fragment.

Scaffolding is [`../towncrier.toml`](../towncrier.toml).
